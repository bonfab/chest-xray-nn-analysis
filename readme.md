# ML in Medical Image Processing of Chest Xrays

## Goals

### Explainability
- Classification of X-Ray images
- Explainability of results with LRP

### Outlier Detection
- Encode images with auto-encoders
- K-means clustering to detect outliers that often represent faulty images

## Requirements

```sh
pip3 install --user --requirement requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, use one of the Docker images defined in the [docker](docker/) directory.

## Usage

We used custom datasets in our Jupyter notebooks, these are available upon request.
